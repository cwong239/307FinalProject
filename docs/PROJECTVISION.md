For photographers who need basic image processing, FotoMagic is an image editing/processing tool which provides a seamless and simple way for users to upload images and apply basic image processing. Unlike Adobe Photoshop, our product is simpler, for only CalPoly students, and easy to use on mobile devices.

As the project progressed, there was minimal to no change in our project vision besides the addition of extra image processing features.
