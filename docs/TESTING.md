Cypress End-to-End testing was implemented, which can be run by entering the frontend folder by typing the command ``` cd frontend ```. Afterwords, by entering the command ``` npm run cy:open ``` will open the Cypress E2E testing application. Next please click the **E2E Testing** option, then click **Chrome** and **Start E2E Testing in Chrome**. This will launch a Chrome window showing a file system with the folder cypress\e2e open, please click the file **spec.cy.js** in the opened folder to begin the E2E testing. From here on, the E2E test will automatically run and the results will be displayed in the open Chrome window.

Specifically, the Cypress E2E test starts off by logining in as a test user and then follows a complete "happy path" for the user story, "As a user, I want to be able to upload an image and apply basic image processing effects so that I can enhance or customize my photos without needing advanced tools." This E2E test has been tested with the code shown in the main branch and succesfully passes the test.
