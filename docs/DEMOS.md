**Note that there is two video demos shown below, this is because the free tier of Azure web services didn't allow the libraries and machine learning model required for background removal functionality to be uploaded and stored on the webserver due to the storage limitations. However, to show the background removal functionality that was implemented, another video demo was recorded except the backend and frontend were hosted locally.**
