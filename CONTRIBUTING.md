Style
- Our team uses the default styling for our languages.
- We use tools like Prettier and ESLint to check our coding style before pushing a change.
    - You can use npm run format inside the frontend to run Prettier
    - To run lint, you can use npm run lint inside the frontend

Tools
- Our team uses git to manage our project.
    - In git we have 3 main branches: main, dev, and frontend.
    - main is our production branch and requires coding reviews before code changes are made to it.
    - dev is our backend branch and they also use code reviews before pushing into dev.
    - frontend is our frontend branch and we use a rebasing strategy for this.
- Style tools mentioned earlier

Libraries 
- Reactjs (frontend)
- look at requiremnts.txt (backend)
